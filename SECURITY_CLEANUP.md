# üîê Security Cleanup - .env File Removed from Git History

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Issue:** `.env` file containing API keys was accidentally committed to Git history  
**Resolution:** Successfully removed from entire repository history using BFG Repo-Cleaner

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

### 1. **Installed Java 21 (OpenJDK)**
```powershell
winget install Microsoft.OpenJDK.21
```

### 2. **Downloaded BFG Repo-Cleaner**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg/1.14.0/bfg-1.14.0.jar" -OutFile "bfg.jar"
```

### 3. **Created Backup Branch**
```bash
git branch backup-before-bfg
```

### 4. **Removed .env from All Commits**
```bash
java -jar bfg.jar --delete-files .env
```

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ Found 13 commits
- ‚úÖ Modified 3 refs (main, backup-before-bfg, origin/main)
- ‚úÖ Deleted .env from 18 object ids
- ‚úÖ First modified commit: `ac8ff881` ‚Üí `6179f258`
- ‚úÖ Last dirty commit: `eaf6ad90` ‚Üí `1661e988`

### 5. **Cleaned Up Repository**
```bash
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

### 6. **Force Pushed to GitHub**
```bash
git push origin main --force
```

**Result:** Repository history rewritten on GitHub ‚úÖ

## üîç Verification

### Before BFG:
```bash
git log --all --full-history -- .env
# Showed multiple commits with .env file
```

### After BFG:
```bash
git log --all --full-history -- .env
# No output - .env completely removed from history ‚úÖ
```

## üö® **CRITICAL: Rotate Your API Keys Immediately**

Even though `.env` is removed from history, **anyone who cloned the repository before this cleanup still has your old API keys** in their local copy. You MUST rotate all compromised keys:

### API Keys to Rotate:

1. **Google Maps API Key**
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
   - Delete old key or restrict it
   - Create new key
   - Update `.env` with new key

2. **Gemini API Key**
   - Go to: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - Revoke old key
   - Create new key
   - Update `.env` with new key

3. **Supabase Keys** (if sensitive)
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pzgpjyqjynjlzjkuijhx/settings/api
   - Review and rotate if needed

### Update .env with New Keys:
```bash
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=<NEW_KEY_HERE>
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<NEW_KEY_HERE>
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_MAP_ID=<YOUR_MAP_ID>
```

## üìã Current Security Status

### ‚úÖ Protected:
- `.env` is in `.gitignore` (both root and backend)
- `.env` removed from entire Git history
- Force pushed to GitHub
- Working tree is clean

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Still Need To Do:
- [ ] Rotate all API keys in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Rotate Gemini API key
- [ ] Update local `.env` with new keys
- [ ] Verify new keys work
- [ ] Delete `bfg.jar` (cleanup tool)

---

## üìö Files Protected by .gitignore

### Frontend (.gitignore):
```
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local
```

### Backend (backend/.gitignore):
```
.env
.venv
__pycache__/
*.log
```

## üîÑ For Team Members (If Any)

If anyone else has cloned this repository, they need to:

1. **Delete their local repository**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   rm -rf all-in-one-virtual-travel-guide
   ```

2. **Clone fresh from GitHub**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lynean/all-in-one-virtual-travel-guide.git
   cd all-in-one-virtual-travel-guide
   ```

3. **Create their own .env from .env.example**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add their own API keys
   ```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Best Practices

### Never Commit Sensitive Files:
1. Always add `.env` to `.gitignore` BEFORE first commit
2. Use `.env.example` to show required variables (without values)
3. Add API keys only to local `.env` file
4. Never commit passwords, tokens, or private keys

### Before Every Commit:
```bash
git status                    # Check what you're committing
git diff --staged             # Review changes
```

### If You Accidentally Commit Secrets:
1. **DON'T** just delete and commit - it's still in history!
2. Use BFG Repo-Cleaner (like we just did)
3. Rotate all exposed credentials immediately
4. Force push to rewrite remote history

## ‚úÖ Summary

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Security Level:** üîê IMPROVED (Pending API key rotation)  
**Next Action:** Rotate all API keys immediately!

The `.env` file has been successfully removed from the entire Git history. However, **you must still rotate all API keys** to ensure complete security, as the old keys may have been accessed before this cleanup.
