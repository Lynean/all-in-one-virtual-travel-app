# Transit Instructions Display Feature

## Overview
Enhanced the MapView component to display detailed, step-by-step transit directions with visual transit information including bus/subway/train lines, stop names, schedules, and fare information.

## Feature Description

When a user requests transit directions (e.g., "How do I get from JFK Airport to Times Square by public transport?"), the app now displays:

### 1. **Route Summary Card**
- Total duration
- Total distance
- Transit fare (if available)

### 2. **Step-by-Step Instructions**
Each step shows either:

#### Walking Steps:
- 🚶 Walking icon
- Distance and duration
- Walking instructions

#### Transit Steps:
- Vehicle-specific icon (🚇 subway, 🚌 bus, 🚂 train, 🚊 light rail, 🚆 rail)
- Transit line badge with color-coded label (e.g., "Red Line", "M15 Bus")
- Headsign ("towards Downtown", "towards Brooklyn")
- **Departure information:**
  - Board stop name
  - Departure time
- Number of stops
- **Arrival information:**
  - Exit stop name
  - Arrival time
- Operating agency information

## Implementation Details

### New State Variable
```typescript
const [transitInstructions, setTransitInstructions] = useState<any>(null);
```

### Enhanced `showDirections` Function

When `travelMode === 'TRANSIT'`, the function now:

1. **Extracts transit details** from the Routes API response
2. **Parses each step** to identify:
   - Walking segments
   - Transit segments (with full details)
3. **Stores structured data** including:
   - Step type (walk/transit)
   - Transit line information
   - Stop details
   - Timing information
   - Fare information

### Data Structure

```typescript
{
  steps: [
    {
      type: 'walk' | 'transit',
      index: number,
      // For walking steps:
      distance: string,
      duration: string,
      instruction: string,
      // For transit steps:
      transitDetails: {
        stopDetails: {
          departureStop: { name, location },
          arrivalStop: { name, location },
        },
        localizedValues: {
          departureTime: { time: { text } },
          arrivalTime: { time: { text } }
        },
        headsign: string,
        transitLine: {
          name: string,
          nameShort: string,
          color: string,
          textColor: string,
          vehicle: { type: 'SUBWAY' | 'BUS' | 'TRAIN' | ... },
          agencies: [{ name, phoneNumber, uri }]
        },
        stopCount: number
      }
    }
  ],
  totalDistance: string,
  totalDuration: string,
  fare?: { currencyCode, units, nanos }
}
```

## UI Components

### Transit Instructions Card
- **Collapsible display** with close button
- **Color-coded transit lines** matching official colors
- **Visual hierarchy** with icons and badges
- **Bordered timeline** showing journey progression
- **Responsive layout** for mobile and desktop

### Vehicle Type Icons
```typescript
🚇 SUBWAY
🚌 BUS
🚂 TRAIN
🚊 LIGHT_RAIL
🚆 RAIL
🚶 WALK
```

### Transit Line Badges
Color-coded badges using official transit colors:
```tsx
<span style={{
  backgroundColor: transitLine.color,
  color: transitLine.textColor
}}>
  {transitLine.nameShort}
</span>
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **User requests transit directions** via AI search
   - Example: "Show me transit directions from Airport to Downtown"

2. **Map displays route polyline** with origin/destination markers

3. **Transit instructions card appears** below the map showing:
   - Summary at the top
   - Step-by-step instructions with visual hierarchy
   - Each step clearly numbered and icon-coded

4. **User can:**
   - Scroll through all steps
   - See exact stop names and times
   - View transit line colors and numbers
   - Check total fare (if available)
   - Close instructions with ✕ button

5. **Instructions persist** when switching tabs (thanks to component mounting fix)

6. **Clear button** removes both map routes and instructions

## Example Output

```
🚇 Transit Directions                                    ✕ Close

## Technical Highlights

### Routes API Integration
- Properly requests transit details with extended field mask
- Handles `routes.legs.steps.transitDetails` response
- Extracts `routes.travelAdvisory.transitFare` when available

### Error Handling
- Gracefully handles missing transit details
- Falls back to basic route display for non-transit modes
- Handles missing fare information
- Displays default icons for unknown vehicle types

### Performance
- Only renders when transit instructions are available
- Efficient state management
- No unnecessary re-renders

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Emoji icons for quick recognition
- Color contrast for readability

## Code Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/components/MapView.tsx`**
   - Added `transitInstructions` state (line ~18)
   - Updated `showDirections()` to extract transit details (lines ~580-625)
   - Added transit instructions display component (lines ~1330-1485)
   - Updated clear button to reset transit instructions (line ~1526)

### Dependencies:
- No new dependencies added
- Uses existing Routes API types
- Uses existing Lucide React icons

## Testing Scenarios

✅ **Test Case 1: Simple Transit Route**
```
Query: "Transit directions from JFK Airport to Times Square"
Expected: Shows subway lines with stop names and times
```

✅ **Test Case 2: Multi-Modal Transit**
```
Query: "How to get from Brooklyn to Queens by bus and subway"
Expected: Shows walking + subway + walking steps
```

✅ **Test Case 3: Transit with Preferences**
```
Query: "Bus directions from Downtown to Airport avoiding trains"
Expected: Shows only bus routes
```

✅ **Test Case 4: Transit with Timing**
```
Query: "Public transport to arrive at 9 AM at office"
Expected: Shows routes with arrival time constraints
```

✅ **Test Case 5: Clear Instructions**
```
Action: Click "Clear Markers & Directions"
Expected: Removes both map polyline and instructions card
```

✅ **Test Case 6: Tab Switching**
```
Action: Get transit directions → Switch to Checklist → Return to Map
Expected: Transit instructions still visible (state preserved)
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Real-time updates**: Show live transit delays
2. **Alternate routes**: Display multiple route options
3. **Accessible transit**: Filter for wheelchair-accessible routes
4. **Save routes**: Bookmark frequently used transit routes
5. **Share routes**: Generate shareable links
6. **Fare comparison**: Compare fares across different routes
7. **Step navigation**: Click step to center map on that location
8. **Print view**: Format for printing directions

### Advanced Features:
- Integration with real-time transit APIs
- Offline transit schedule caching
- Transit alerts and service disruptions
- Estimated crowding levels
- Carbon footprint comparison vs driving
