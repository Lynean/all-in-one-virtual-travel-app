## ‚ú® Best Practices

### 1. **Be Specific with Place Types**
```javascript
// ‚ùå Too generic
{ query: "food", includedTypes: ["restaurant"] }

// ‚úÖ Specific
{ query: "italian restaurant", includedTypes: ["italian_restaurant"] }
```

### 2. **Combine Filters Logically**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Logical combination
{
  query: "family restaurant",
  goodForChildren: true,
  parking: true,
  priceLevel: "MODERATE"
}

// ‚ùå Contradictory
{
  query: "fine dining",
  priceLevel: "INEXPENSIVE"  // Unlikely combination
}
```

### 3. **Use Appropriate Radius**
```javascript
// Urban area - smaller radius
{ radius: 2000 }  // 2km for dense cities

// Suburban - medium radius
{ radius: 5000 }  // 5km for suburbs

// Rural - larger radius
{ radius: 20000 }  // 20km for rural areas
```

### 4. **Omit Unnecessary Fields**
Only include filters that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied:
```javascript
// ‚ùå Too many assumptions
{
  query: "restaurant",
  goodForChildren: true,    // Not mentioned
  parking: true,            // Not mentioned
  outdoorSeating: true      // Not mentioned
}

// ‚úÖ Only what's mentioned
{
  query: "restaurant",
  openNow: true  // User said "open now"
}
```

### 5. **Handle Ambiguous Queries**
```javascript
// "Cheap eats" ‚Üí Could mean multiple things
{
  query: "restaurant",
  priceLevel: "INEXPENSIVE",
  includedTypes: ["restaurant", "fast_food_restaurant", "food_court"]
}

// "Coffee" ‚Üí Be specific about type
{
  query: "coffee shop",
  servesCoffee: true,
  includedTypes: ["cafe", "coffee_shop"]
}
```

## üöÄ Advanced Use Cases

### 1. **Dietary Restrictions**
```javascript
// Vegan traveler
"Find vegan restaurants with outdoor seating"
‚Üí {
  servesVegetarianFood: true,
  outdoorSeating: true,
  includedTypes: ["vegan_restaurant", "vegetarian_restaurant"]
}
```

### 2. **Family Travel**
```javascript
// Family with kids
"Kid-friendly restaurants with parking and bathrooms"
‚Üí {
  goodForChildren: true,
  parking: true,
  restroom: true,
  menuForChildren: true
}
```

### 3. **Accessibility Needs**
```javascript

"Wheelchair accessible cafes"
‚Üí {
  accessibilityOptions: true,
  includedTypes: ["cafe"]
}
```

### 4. **Business Travel**
```javascript
// Business lunch
"Reservable restaurants good for groups"
‚Üí {
  reservable: true,
  goodForGroups: true,
  priceLevel: "MODERATE"
}
```

### 5. **Late Night Options**

‚Üí {
  openNow: true,
  delivery: true,
  includedTypes: ["restaurant", "fast_food_restaurant"]
}
```

## üìä Filter Priority

When multiple filters are specified, they work together as **AND conditions**:

```javascript
// All conditions must be met
{
  query: "restaurant",
  servesVegetarianFood: true,  // AND
  goodForChildren: true,        // AND
  parking: true,                // AND
  openNow: true                 // AND
}
```

**Result**: Only restaurants that are:
- Vegetarian-friendly AND
- Kid-friendly AND
- Have parking AND
- Currently open

## üß™ Testing Advanced Queries

### Test Cases
```python
# Test 1: Dietary + Atmosphere
await agent.process_message(
    "Find vegetarian restaurants with outdoor seating",
    session_id="test"
)
# Expected: servesVegetarianFood=true, outdoorSeating=true

# Test 2: Family-friendly
await agent.process_message(
    "Kid-friendly cafes with parking",
    session_id="test"
)
# Expected: goodForChildren=true, parking=true

# Test 3: Price + Rating + Amenities
await agent.process_message(
    "Cheap breakfast places with takeout, rated above 4 stars",
    session_id="test"
)
# Expected: priceLevel=INEXPENSIVE, servesBreakfast=true, takeout=true, minRating=4.0

# Test 4: Complex multi-filter
await agent.process_message(
    "Pet-friendly restaurants with outdoor seating, good for groups, open now",
    session_id="test"
)
# Expected: allowsDogs=true, outdoorSeating=true, goodForGroups=true, openNow=true
```

## üìù Notes

1. **Not all fields are available for all places**: Some fields are only available with premium tiers (Enterprise, Enterprise + Atmosphere)

2. **Field availability varies by place type**: For example, `servesBreakfast` only applies to restaurants/cafes

3. **Multiple types can be combined**: `includedTypes: ["cafe", "bakery"]` searches for both

4. **Price level is subjective**: Based on local market standards

5. **Rating is average**: Places with few reviews may have unreliable ratings

6. **openNow is real-time**: Reflects current operating status

7. **Boolean filters reduce results**: Each filter narrows the search - use judiciously
